                    <p>Oinx is a project I made at Wealthsimple's first ever hackathon. A bunch of my coworkers and I noticed we all had many goals in mind, but didn't really have much of a plan for saving money to reach them.</p>
                    <p> Thus, Oinx was designed to address the need of a tool for young people to manage their money smarter. Users can choose how much money they want to allocate to their "treats," while saving the rest toward their future. Graphs track users' upcoming goals and prompt them to save more if they won't reach a goal in time, or withdraw funds right in the app when they're achieved.

                    <p>Players can choose to alter Pricing, Advertisment, Staffing and Purchasing factors, all while keeping track of recent news and stats. All of this factors into a calculation that determines customer behaviour and ultimately the amount of sushi you sell.</p>

                     <p>Being tired of having to leave the Messenger app and open a web browser to search for song lyrics in Google, I decided to create something that would let me do it within the app. LyricCat is a messenger chatbot that will give you the entire lyrics to a song given its name and artist. 
                     </p>
                     <p>The idea was well recieved by my friends in a group chat, who use it frequently to obnoxiously spam each other with the lyrics to the song currently stuck in their heads. A future feature for LyricCat is for it to reply with lyrics in real time as they are sung in the song.
